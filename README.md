## Abstract

The rise of the Internet and Industry 4.0 has resulted in numerous changes in how people live and work. The aeronautical industry is one of those that has been severely impacted. The use of commercial flights has grown in popularity, as has the need for effective communication systems. The Aeronautical Ad hoc NETwork (AANET) is a wireless communication system that allows aircraft to communicate with one another as well as with ground stations. The application of various optimization algorithms is critical in determining the best data packet routing path within the AANET. The impact of the Internet and Industry 4.0 on the aeronautical industry, the use of commercial flights and the need for efficient communication systems, the Aeroneutical Ad hoc NETwork (AANET) and its importance, and the use of optimization algorithms in determining the optimal data packet routing path within the AANET will all be discussed, having important metrics such as end-to-end transmission rate and end-to-end latency.
